# Objects

Class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns,
for example media object known from OOCSS. They provide structure to your
content, do not contain any cosmetic CSS, and they should never been
directly overwritten.

This is the first layer in which we find class-based selectors. These are
concerned with styling non-cosmetic design patterns, or 'objects'. Objects
can range from something as simple as a .wrapper element, to layout
systems, through to things.

!> **Warning broken changes from 2.0.0**: Because we use modular imports,
the previously used `$global-` and local prefixes (like `$tools-`) were
removed, the variable names became shorter. Instead of those prefixes you
have to use the `settings` namespace for the global variables and the `_`
prefix for the local variables, like:

```scss
@use "../settings";
@use "../tools" as *;

$line-height: 1.5;

.c-branding {
  @include type(settings.$heading1-font-size);

  color: settings.$color-brand;
  line-height: $line-height;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-family: settings.$font-family-heading;
}
```

## Container Object

The container object is responsible for creating smart, flexible and
responsive containers.

For default container you can use the `make-container` mixin from
`2.tools/_tools.container.scss`. Here we add a css class for that.
You can set up here for additional container sizes and paddings.

?> Learn more about [Container Tool](2.tools.md#container-tool).

?> You can find an easily modify all settings in
`4.objects/_objects.container.scss`:

### Container namespaces

```scss
$container-class: "o-container";
$container-class-mod: $container-class + "--";
```

### Container with default responsive gutter

It will create a default container with `10px` padding in mobile and
`20px` in tablets and up.

```scss
$container-gutter-default: (
  null: 1rem,
  small: 2rem
);
```

### Container with responsive size

It will create a container that will have max-width of `320px` in mobile
and `max-width` of `1024px` in tablets and up.

```scss
$container-size-default: (
  null: 32rem,
  small: 102.4rem
);
```

### Additional container gutters

Allows you to specify more sets of padding left and right of your
container.
You can use a nested map in case you would like to specify responsive
gutter sizes.

Each gutter size will be available as a BEM modifier that will be named
according to the gutter name.

```scss
$container-gutter-extra: ();
```

For example if `$container-gutter-extra: (large: 3rem);`
then `.o-container--large` will be available for use:

```scss
$container-gutter-extra: (
  large: (
    null: 2rem,
    small: 4rem
  )
);
```

```html
<div class="o-container--large">...</div>
```

### Additional container sizes

Allows you to specify more sets of `max-width` for your container. You can
use a nested map in case you would like to specify a responsive size.

Each gutter size will be available as a BEM modifier that will be named
according to the container size name.

```scss
$container-size-extra: ();
```

For example if `$container-size-extra: (large: 160rem);`
then `.o-container--large` will be available for use:

```scss
$container-size-extra: (
  large: (
    null: 30rem,
    small: 120rem
  )
);
```

```html
<div class="o-container--large">...</div>
```
