# Utilities

Utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes
before in the triangle, ex. hide helper class.

They are usually one line of code and have an `!important` rule to make
sure they override all element styles when used and not be overridden from
other sources.

## Clearfix Utility

The clearfix utility is used on elements that need to automatically clear
their child elements.

```html
<div class="u-clearfix">
  <div>Floated item</div>
  <div>Floated item</div>
</div>
```

?> It's built on and you can use it as mixin too via
[Clearfix Tool](2.tools.md#clearfix-tool):
2.tools/_tools.clearfix.scss

## Stretched Link Utility

Make any HTML element or a component clickable by "stretching" a nested
link via css.

Add `.u-stretched-link` class to a link (`<a>` element) to make its
containing block clickable via a `::after` pseudo element.
In most cases, this means that an element with `position: relative;`
that contains a link with the `.u-stretched-link` class is clickable.

```html
<div class="o-media u-position-relative">
  <div class="o-media__fixed">
    <img src="..." alt="...">
  </div>
  <div class="o-media__fluid">
    <h5>Media with stretched link</h5>
    <p>Cras sit amet nibh libero, in gravida nulla. Nulla vel metus
    scelerisque ante sollicitudin. Cras purus odio, vestibulum in
    vulputate at, tempus viverra turpis.</p>
    <a href="#" class="u-stretched-link">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

?> Shake.sass has not `.u-position-relative` class, it just show witch
element has `position: relative;` property.

?> It's built on and you can use it as mixin too via
[Stretched Link Tool](2.tools.md#stretched-link-tool):
2.tools/_tools.stretched-link.scss

## Text Utility

The text utility contains helper classes for easier control text blocks.

### Text alignment class list

- `.u-text--left`
- `.u-text--right`
- `.u-text--center`
- `.u-text--justify`
- `.u-text--justify-left`
- `.u-text--justify-right`
- `.u-text--justify-center`

### Enable responsive text utilities

By enabling the responsive text utilities, you have access to a set of
utility classes which bind to breakpoints.

?> By default, they bind to the global breakpoints specified in
1.settings/_settings.breakpoints.scss.

In 6.utilities/_utilities.text.scss:

```scss
$utilities-text-responsive  : true;
$utilities-text-breakpoints : $global-breakpoints;
```

In a component HTML file:

```html
<h1 class="u-text--center u-text--right@small">
  Heading will be aligned center on mobile and right on tablets and up.
</h1>
```

## Video Utility

Video utility to make responsive videos.
_Images, SVGs are responsive by default!_

For responsive video, add a container with the `.u-video-responsive`
class.\
Insert any YouTube, Vimeo or other iframe/embed video inside the
container.\
The ratio is 16:9 by default. You may add `.u-video-responsive--4-3`
for 4:3 ratio video container or `.u-video-responsive--1-1` for 1:1 ratio.

```html
<div class="u-video-responsive u-video-responsive--4-3">
  <iframe src="..." width="..." height="..." frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

For responsive `<video>` elements, you can add the `.u-video-responsive`
class directly.

```html
<video class="u-video-responsive" src="...">...</video>
```

## Visibility Utility

Control the visibility, without modifying the display, of elements with
visibility utilities.

### Visibility class list

- `.u-show`
- `.u-hide`
- `.u-visually-hide`
- `.u-visually-hide--focusable`

### Enable responsive visibility utilities

By enabling the responsive visibility utilities, you have access to a
set of utility classes which bind to breakpoints.

?> By default, they bind to the global breakpoints specified in
`1.settings/_settings.breakpoints`.

In 6.utilities/_utilities.visibility.scss:

```scss
$utilities-visibility-responsive  : true;
$utilities-visibility-breakpoints : $global-breakpoints;
```

In a component HTML file:

```html
<h1 class="u-hide@large">
  Heading will be hidden on larger screens.
</h1>
```

### Hide only visually

Use visually hide utilities to hide elements on all devices except screen
 readers. Hide an element to all devices except screen readers with
`.u-visually-hide` class.

```html
<h1 class="page__title u-visually-hide">
  Page title
</h1>
```

### Focusable Visually hide

Combine `.u-visually-hide` with `.u-visually-hide--focusable` class to
show the element again when it’s focused (ex. by a keyboard-only user).

```html
<a class="u-visually-hide u-visually-hide--focusable" href="#content">
  Skip to main content
</a>
```

?> It's built on and you can use these as mixin too via
