# Components

Specific UI components.

This is where majority of our work takes place and our UI components are
often composed of Objects and Components.
They contain cosmetic CSS, and they can be directly overwritten to fit your
UI Kit style.

## Icon Component

Theming SVG icons. Use the same color as its parent.

## Page Component

Made the page full height.

## Table Component

CSS class based table themings, like responsive table.

### Responsive Table Component

Responsive CSS only table component based on
[Filament Group's Tablesaw](https://github.com/filamentgroup/tablesaw).
There is no any styling only layout needed properties.

Available settings in 5.components/_components.table.scss:

```scss
$components-responsive-table               : true;
$components-responsive-table-label-padding : 0 .6em 0 0;
$components-responsive-table-label-width   : 30%;
$components-responsive-table-content-width : 67%;
```

An example in a component HTML file:

```html
<table class="c-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>name</th>
      <th>genre</th>
      <th>release date</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b class="c-table__cell-label">name</b>
        <span class="c-table__cell-content">The Shawshank Redemption</span>
      </td>
      <td>
        <b class="c-table__cell-label">genre</b>
        <span class="c-table__cell-content">Crime, Drama</span>
      </td>
      <td>
