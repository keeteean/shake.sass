/**
 ******************************************************************************
 *** STRETCHED LINK TOOL ***
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * Make any HTML element or a component clickable by "stretching" a nested link
 * via css.
 *
 * Borrowed from Bootstrap 4
 * @link https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/utilities/stretched-link
 *
 * Include `stretched-link` mixin to a link (`<a>` element) to make its
 * containing block clickable via a `::after` pseudo element.
 * In most cases, this means that an element with `position: relative;` that
 * contains a link with included `stretched-link` mixin is clickable.
 *
 * @example
 *   @use "../tools";
 *
 *   .o-media {
 *     position: relative;
 *
 *     &__link {
 *       @include tools.stretched-link;
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * You can use it as utility class too:
 * @see 6.utilities/_utilities.stretched-link.scss
