# Settings

Setting files contain **global** configurations that are shared by more than
one module.

Those settings that are connected to only a specific module they are must
be a part of that module itself.

Local configurations should be contained by the related modules (objects,
components, etc.) where they are related to.

Itâ€™s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
