# Objects

Class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns. They provide
structure to your content, do not contain any cosmetic CSS, and they should
never be directly overwritten.

This is the first layer in which we find class-based selectors. These are
concerned with styling non-cosmetic design patterns, or 'objects'. Objects
can range from something as simple as a .wrapper element to layout systems.
