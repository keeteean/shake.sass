# Base

Base styles are the default styles of base elements. It's the SMACSS base level,
witch is the combination of ITCSS's Generic and Elements layers.

A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, a descendant
selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes. It doesn't
include any class or ID selectors. Base styles are related to the basic
styles of an application, like Typography, Reset and styling of global elements.

This is the first layer which generates actual CSS, so begins with this directory to down
all Sass files will begin without an underscore.
